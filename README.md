# pycom-ble-nus
This project came to be as part of my meanderings into the usage of Pycom devices.  I have always made good use of Nordic Semiconductor's UART Service(NUS) for on other platforms, hwoever I was not able to find a good example on how to get NUS going on a Pycom device. After probing the Pycom documention and many forums, I finally managed to piece together this project to show a functioning NUS service for any Pycom device.  I used LoPy4 as part of my development.

To show how to use the class I put together, a simple 'guess my number' game is implemented.

To interact with the service, I have used the Bluefruit Connect app for IOS, made by Adafruit.

Enjoy.
